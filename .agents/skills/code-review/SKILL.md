# DDC NL Code Review

Review the diff along two axes:

- **Standards:** whether the change follows DDC NL repository rules and local conventions.
- **Spec:** whether the change matches the user request, issue, PRD, or `tasks/plan.md`.

## 1. Pin the Diff

Use the fixed point supplied by the user. If none is supplied, default to:

```bash
git diff origin/main...HEAD
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
```

Confirm the fixed point resolves and the diff is non-empty. If the working tree has uncommitted changes, include them in the review by inspecting `git diff` and `git diff --staged` as well.

Completion criterion: the reviewed change set is explicit.

## 2. Gather Standards

Read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `CONTEXT.md` when public copy or domain terms changed
- Any local coding standards or task files relevant to the diff

Apply these standing DDC NL checks:

- Public copy uses `Talent Center DDC` and `DDC NL` terminology.
- Public slugs, template names, CSS/JS ids, and classes are changed only with usage checks.
- Secrets and private customer data are not committed.
- `images/`, `videos/`, `.env`, `.DS_Store`, and `node_modules/` are not staged.
- Generated style files stay aligned with SCSS when styles change.
- PHP and JS checks required by `AGENTS.md` are run or explicitly blocked.
- No AI attribution trailers are added to commits.

Completion criterion: every applicable standard source has been considered.

## 3. Gather Spec

Use the first available source:

1. The user's request in the conversation.
2. `tasks/plan.md` and `tasks/todo.md`.
3. A supplied issue, PRD, or spec file.

If no spec exists, report that the Spec axis is limited to the conversation request.

Completion criterion: the behavior expected by the change is stated.

## 4. Review

Report findings under these exact headings:

```markdown
## Standards
- [Severity] [file:line] Finding, why it matters, and suggested fix.

## Spec
- [Severity] [file:line] Finding, missing/incorrect behavior, and suggested fix.
```

Severity values:

- `Blocking`: must fix before PR.
- `Non-blocking`: worth addressing, but PR can proceed.
- `Question`: needs product or user clarification.

Focus on bugs, regressions, missing verification, security/privacy mistakes, and spec mismatches. Keep style-only feedback brief unless it violates a documented rule.

## Completion

Review is complete when both axes have either concrete findings or an explicit pass, and the final line states the count of blocking findings.
